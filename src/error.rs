/// Error types used by multiple modules.

///
/// The most important is [`Failed`]. This error indicates that an
/// operation had to be canceled for some reason and callers can assume
/// that all diagnostic information has been logged and they need not do
/// anything further.
///
/// Secondly, [`ExitError`] is used when the program should be terminated. It
/// provides enough information to determine the exit code of the program.

/// This error types is used to indicate that an operation has failed,
/// diagnostic information has been printed or logged, and the caller canâ€™t
/// really do anything to recover.
